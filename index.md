__PO Box 34__ aims to connect incarcerated writers with a wider audience, including writing mentors and educators, collaborators from the international visual arts community, musicians, performers, people who express creatively. I hope this will open up conversation and ultimately get feedback, correspondence & connection to the writers and artists in prison.

The world is burning.

We have set up a [GoFundMe](http://gf.me/u/yp8fys) page to raise funds to keep the project running. Thank you for your support!

Please send writing submissions, artwork, & inquiries to PO Box 34, Collingswood, NJ. 08108, USA or email pobox34@protonmail.com.
